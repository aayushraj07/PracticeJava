Types of Sorting : 
Bubble Sort;
Selection Sort;
Insertion Sort;

Bubble ->
it compares every adjacent element and puts
bigger element to after the smaller element

O(n^2) time complexity

largest number will be at end,
-> [3,6,2,7,1,9]
it will happen in multiple iterations;
-> [1,2,3,6,7,9]

Selection ->
here we pick the first number and compare it to adjacent 
and pick the smaller number once the iteration is done 
we will have the smallest number and put it in the 0th place
